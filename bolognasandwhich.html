	<title>The Most Delicious Bologna Sandwhich of all time!</title>
	<P>Ready to sink your teeth into the ost delicious thing you could find in your fridge at 3am?</P>
	<h3>Step One</h3>
	<p>Get your ingredients</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bologna</li>
		<li>Bread</li>
		<li>Butter</li>
		<li>Mustard</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Step Two</h3>
	<P>place your bread on your makeshift plate, in my case we used a piece of paper towel, however, plastic containers or that test that you failed last week works too.</P>

	<h3>Step Three</h3>
	<p>Next you'll want to apply the butter to each slice of bread</p>

	<h3>Step Four</h3>
	<p>Next you'll want to apply the mustard, this flavour isn't everyone's favourite flavour so it can be replaced with ketchup, ranch or whatever sort of conidment you have that will hide the fact that you're eating bologna.</p>

	<h3>Step Five</h3>
	<p>Add the bologna. You decide how many slices you want to torture yourself with, I chose to use simply 2 slices.
