			<h1>Welcome to Broken College Kitchen!</h1>
			<p>Are you to lazy to walk to the cafeteria? Too tired to go to the grocery store? Or do your annoying roomates keep telling you that water is an essential part of your helath and well being?  Welcome to broken college kitchen, here we encourage students to cook their own food and make their own meals(without burning down their residence buildings). BCK is not only a place for diving into delicious recipes and funky kitchen tips, but it's also a community, for those who lack grace in the kitchen. With our help you can bond with your roomate over cooking a delicios pan of eggrolls(and forget about who keeps leaving the cap off the toothpaste)or find some pride in yourself when you are able to make your own meal without facetiming your mom for help. Broke College Kitchen is a place for those who are hungry and broke, so welcome to our kitchen </p>

			<h2>Why Should You Trust Us?</h2>
			<p>You should trust us because who else is there to trust. Fancy food blogs aren't going to help you, you dont have any money for fancy spices or fresh vegetables. We'll cater to your needs. We are commited to making student lives better. Don't believe us? Here are comments straight from students themsleves who have firsthand been affected by BCK.</p>

			<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
			<h3>Erin Dunn - Creator</h3>
			<p>Erin Dunn grabbed inspiration for this website from the fact that she hadn't eaten vegetables in a week. She has no money for fresh ingredients and her favourite food has now become bologna sandwhiches(where does bologna even come from? We don't know and we do NOT wanna find out anytime soon). Thank you for joining the adveture's into the kitchen and particpiating in the hectic kitchen community, I couldn't have done it without you.   </p>
